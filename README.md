I am a Business Analyst and I will graduating in Big Data and Analytical Intelligence, work focused on problem solving and prioritize fast delivery to build solutions that improve products and services.
I believe that my 13 years of experience in the Automotive Industry contribute to innovative ideas and thinking difirent!

Currently I dedicate my studies to Data Science, and created this portfolio to demonstrate the development of my skills in problem solving.

During free time, I am a hobbyist musician and develop IoT projects by building my own equipment, at the moment I have fun developing an electronic drum with Arduino to control virtual instruments!
