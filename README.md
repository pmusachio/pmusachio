# Paulo Musachio Portfolio
This project contains links to my all portfolio projects, and the main objective is demonstrate my skills in solving business problems through my knowledge in Data Science.

# About me
I'm a Data Scientist in training at the **Comunidade DS** and I'm graduating Big Data and Analytical Intelligence.
 
I like dynamic environments and I adapt quickly to changes, I have 13 years of experience in the Automotive Industry, and of these, 9 as a Process and Quality Analyst developing projects focused on continuous improvement exploring data, investigating and validating hypotheses, **creating simple and creative solutions to large problems**.

During free time, I am a hobbyist musician and develop IoT projects by building my own equipment, at the moment I have fun developing an electronic drum with Arduino to control virtual instruments!
